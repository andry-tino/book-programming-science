## Sectioning
The book should be structured this way:

- Part
    - Chapter
        - Section

Parts will divide the content by level: _simple_, _intermediate_, _advanced_. The recipe
in each part will target more complex scenarios and they build on top of the knowledge
created in previous chapters.

Chapters will focus on a scientific topic: a mathematical model, a scientific area or a
specific problem to solve.

Sections are used to divide the recipes for a topic into subtopics. They can section a recipe
into parts or define different connected recipes.

## Defining topics
The content of chapters has to be defined by setting objectives. The approach can be
science-oriented and programming-oriented. Every chapter must define an objective in terms
of knowledge that will be created by the recipes defined therein. The following questions
can be useful:

- What will this chapter teach you?
    - What new programming skills will you acquire?
    - What new mathematical skills will you acquire?
- What knowledge is required to understand the recipes in this chapter?
    - What programming skills are you expected to have already?
    - What mathematical notions are you expected to be familiar with?

Define chapters as a sequence.
