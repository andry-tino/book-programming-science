\begin{sol}{prob:evolvetoward111}
\textbf{Find the remaining evolutions}\\
We have already checked, in example \ref{ex:stateled4}, that
$(0,1,0) \overset{f}{\rightarrow} (1,1,1)$, so we need to check the other possible
states different from $(0,0,0)$.
\begin{itemize}
\item If we consider $x_0 = (1,0,0)$, then we have that: $(1,0,0) \rightarrow (1,0,1) \rightarrow (1,1,1)$.
\item If we consider $x_0 = (0,0,1)$, then we have that: $(0,0,1) \rightarrow (0,1,1) \rightarrow (1,1,1)$.
\end{itemize}
The remaining initial configurations are: $(1,1,0)$, $(1,0,1)$, $(0,1,1)$ and $(1,1,1)$. But those are already
known because they are covered by the evolution of the initial configurations we covered before. For example,
$(1,1,0)$ is the second configuration the CA assumes after $(0,1,0)$.
\end{sol}


\begin{sol}{prob:testcyclic}
\textbf{Period of a cyclic initial condition}\\
In example \ref{ex:stateled3}, we need to start from $x_0 = (1,0,1)$ and calculate the evolution of the automaton.
We have that $x_1 = (0,1,1)$, then $x_2 = (1,1,0)$ and $x_3 = x_ 0 = (1,0,1)$. We got back to the initial
condition after $T=3$ cycles.
\end{sol}

\begin{sol}{prob:changecasize}
\textbf{Change the size of the CA}\\
In \texttt{ca.js}, inside our Javascript module, we have created two contants to use to set the size of the
automaton. If we change their values, we will get a different size. For example, to have a 20x20 grid,
we just do:
\begin{code}
const rowsnum = 20;
const colsnum = 20;
\end{code}
Or:
\begin{code}
const rowsnum = 20;
const colsnum = 30;
\end{code}
If we want a rectangular automaton.
\end{sol}

\begin{sol}{prob:changeinit}
\textbf{Setting a different initial condition}\\
We have created, inside our Javascript module in \texttt{ca.js}, a constant called: \texttt{initConfig}.
By specifying different cell IDs, we can set a different initial configuration:
\begin{code}
const initConfig = ["3:1", "1:3", "4:4"];
\end{code}
\end{sol}

\begin{sol}{prob:cacolor}
\textbf{Active cells with a different color}\\
We set to black the color of active cells. If you remember, we set this color in our stylesheet
\texttt{style.css}. In there, we need to change the CSS rule for active cells and change the value
of CSS property \texttt{background-color}:
\begin{codeh1}{1}{3}
.cell[data-value="1"] {
  background-color: #f00;
}
\end{codeh1}
In this example, we set it to red.
