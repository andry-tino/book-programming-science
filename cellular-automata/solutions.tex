\begin{sol}{prob1}
We have already checked, in example \ref{ex:stateled4}, that
$(0,1,0) \overset{f}{\rightarrow} (1,1,1)$, so we need to check the other possible
states different from $(0,0,0)$. It is important to notice that if we ever reach configuration
$(1,1,1)$, all successive configurations will be the same (a concept introduced a bit later 
in definition \ref{def:finalconf}). So we just need to prove that all remaining configurations,
will reach $(1,1,1)$:
\begin{itemize}
\item If we consider $x_0 = (1,0,0)$, the we have that 
\end{itemize}
\end{sol}
