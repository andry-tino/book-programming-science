\section{Final remarks}

We have completed our experience with CA. As you could see, they are beautiful mathematical,
programmable, visual structures that have a variety of different applications. We have experimented
with them by crafting one automaton to study and solve problems in a society; but there are many
more fields where CA can prove to be very useful so we encourage you to keep experimenting more
by creating more automata and check their evolutions.
