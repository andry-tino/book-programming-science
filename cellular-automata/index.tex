\abstract{
Populations represent a subject of study which is very prominent today. Studying and analyzing
how groups of people, societies and communities behave under certain conditions is at the
foundation of many technological advancements made by human kind. The models developed in this
area have contributed to great progress in Biology, Medicine, urban development and so on. In this
chapter, we are going to delve into populations dynamics in order to acquire important information
to be used in many contexts.
