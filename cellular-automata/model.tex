\section{Defining the model}
\label{sec:model}

Following the typical approaches in Computational Linguistics, we need to formalise the target language.
A valid sign is therefore represented by an ordered 2-dimension tuple:

In the context of our effort, we will not handle strings of full tokens $\Phi \in \mathcal{S}^\ast$ as we will
be missing, for each token $s = (\Sigma, \sigma) \in \mathcal{S}$, the information on $\sigma$.
